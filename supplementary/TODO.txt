## High priority installation

artemis http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/#download
MACS  https://github.com/taoliu/MACS
SnpEff http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/download.html
VEP http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html
Gemini http://gemini.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/installation.html#automated-installation


Add categories tool categories so can load related tools together eg.
  variants
  chipseq
  rnaseq
  utils
  cnv
 

## Notes

This ansible for linux machine, if other machine will be in mind, don't forget to switch featureCounts make file type

added sudo rstudio-server verify-installation to varify?

## Update README

Most (all) of the java tools will be tied with java_oracle installation before hand. If java oracle app isn't installed then no other java oracle
depended tools will be installed. Refere to java oracle installation guide - need to manually download it into tarballs directory

Java Oracle dependent

- igv
- bds

## Questions

- need to understand ports. Why TCP 3838 for ShinyApps and not HTTP/HTTPS ?
- also nestat -tuple showed port 3838 before I enabled it?


## Nginx 

- [nice installation guied](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04)
- `/var/www/html` - default location for file serving

#### Improtant nginx files

- `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` - The main Nginx configuration file. This can be modified to make changes to the Nginx global configuraiton.
- `/etc/nginx/sites-available` - The directory where per-site "server blocks" can be stored. Nginx will not use the configuration files found in this directory unless they are linked to the sites-enabled directory (see below). Typically, all server block configuration is done in this directory, and then enabled by linking to the other directory.
- `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` - The directory where enabled per-site "server blocks" are stored. Typically, these are created by linking to configuration files found in the sites-available directory

####

Need to include modules labeling guide

use the same case as how you would run the tool on the command line e.g snpEff as a module name because you'd run snpEff on the command line
e.g SPAdes module should actually be called, spades, because this is how you'd run it on the commnand line. Also there shouldn't be any "v" prefixes in the module names

####

Need to add args:
               create: dest to apps/bin/file
on all of the downloading steps, because it keeps re-downloading every apppp, which isn't desirable. From reading docs quicly I'd have to set up a register and use with when option instead
