# TODO:
#  - Settings to ensure user containers aren't on NFS: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-nfs
#  - Populate /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid for key users: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman
#    - We need to ensure these uid ranges don't clash with any in use on the host (eg high Authcate UIDs)
#    - We need to ensure these uid/gid ranges don't overlap
#    - We probably want a smaller range per user than the default 65536
#    - Maximum UID is 4,294,967,296 
#      - systemd and Debian reserve some ranges around ~60000-65536, so avoid those.
#      - snapd maps to 524288-589823 so avoid those.
#  - Helper script to properly add a user to /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, create non-NFS container directory
