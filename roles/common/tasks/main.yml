# This installs a system-wide verison of R. It's useful for short-lived
# throwaway VMs (eg training workshops), but it's generally a bad idea 
# to use this for a long-term shared system since you can't easily support 
# multiple versions of R this way, and unless you actively `apt-mark hold` 
# the appropriate R packages, automatic updates will eventually can change 
# the R version breaking users existing environments.
# 
# It's better to use the R version(s) provided by the lmod module system (roles/R).
